# 30-days-of-brainfuck
Implementing brainfuck interpreter, in 30 languages.

The goal here is obviously to learn new languages and new paradigms.

# Usage
`./test.sh <language1> [language2] […]` or `./test.sh *`

Time excludes compilation time.
Computed on Fedora 28 with i7-8550U.
No power management (charging).

"factor.bf" time excludes warmup (hello_world.bf) time.

Yes, I know, the perl and ruby implementations are unfair.
